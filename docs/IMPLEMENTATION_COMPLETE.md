- Shared credentials concerns
- Mitigation strategies for each risk

## Files Changed

### New Files (16)
- `src/lib/auth.ts`
- `docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`
- `docs/OAUTH_BYPASS_SUMMARY.md`
- `docs/INDEX.md`
- `.env.example`
- 11 documentation files moved to `/docs`

### Modified Files (11)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Enable bypass
cp .env.example .env
# Set NEXT_PUBLIC_BYPASS_AUTH="true" in .env

# Run

```

## Documentation

All documentation is now in `/docs`:
- Start here: `docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`
- Technical details: `docs/OAUTH_BYPASS_SUMMARY.md`
- Complete index: `docs/INDEX.md`

## Production Notes

**Before deploying to production:**
1. Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_BYPASS_AUTH` is unset or "false"
2. Test Google OAuth flow
3. Remove dev environment files
4. Review authentication middleware
5. Set up monitoring

## Success Criteria Met

✅ Test the app - Successfully tested with bypass enabled
✅ Bypass Google OAuth - Implemented and working
✅ Organize documents - All docs in `/docs` folder
✅ No breaking changes - Backward compatible
✅ Security maintained - Comprehensive warnings and safeguards
✅ Well documented - 3 new comprehensive guides
✅ Tested thoroughly - Unit tests, manual tests, code review

## Status: COMPLETE ✅

All requirements met. Ready for review and merge.
