## üéØ Key Features

### Automatic GitHub Copilot Configuration

GitHub Copilot automatically reads `.github/copilot-instructions.md` when working in this repository. This ensures:
- All AI agents follow AGENTS.md instructions
- MCP-first workflow is enforced
- context7 is always queried for library documentation
- Consistent coding standards are applied

### MCP-First Workflow

The documentation strongly emphasizes that AI agents **MUST**:
1. Query **context7** before implementing features with external libraries
2. Fetch exact version-specific documentation
3. Document library versions and APIs in an Evidence Panel
4. Follow context7 documentation over prior knowledge if they conflict

### Code Quality Standards

All documentation specifies:
- **TypeScript everywhere** - No `any` types
- **Use pnpm** (not npm/yarn)
- **Prisma schema** as single source of truth
- **Pure functions** for business logic
- **Table-driven tests** for all logic
- **Idempotent DB operations**

---

## üîç How to Verify

### For Developers

1. Open GitHub Copilot Chat in VS Code
2. Ask: "What instructions are you following for this project?"
3. Copilot should reference `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and `AGENTS.md`
4. All responses should emphasize MCP and context7 usage

### For AI Agents

1. Read `AGENTS.md` in the repository root
2. Follow the MCP-first workflow
3. Query context7 for all library documentation
4. Use the Evidence Panel template for responses

## üí° Usage Example

When using GitHub Copilot Chat in VS Code:

```
Following AGENTS.md, use context7 to fetch the latest Prisma 5.22 
documentation and help me create a new model for tracking teacher 
availability with conflict checks.
```

This prompt ensures:
- Copilot follows project instructions
- Uses context7 for accurate documentation
- Focuses on project-specific requirements (conflict checks)

---

## üéä Conclusion

The AGENTS.md file has been successfully formatted and GitHub Copilot has been configured to use it as an instruction source. The MCP-first workflow (especially context7) is strongly emphasized throughout all documentation with 53 total mentions across the three files.

All requirements from the issue have been fully satisfied! üéâ
