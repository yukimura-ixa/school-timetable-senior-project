## Prerequisites

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Install Playwright Browsers**
   ```bash
   pnpm playwright:install
   ```

3. **Set Up Test Environment**
   - Ensure database is running
   - Configure `.env` file with test credentials
   - Seed database with test data (optional but recommended)

## Running Tests

### Run All Tests
```bash
pnpm test:e2e
```

### Run Tests in UI Mode (Interactive)
```bash
pnpm test:e2e:ui
```

### Run Specific Test File
```bash
pnpm playwright test e2e/01-home-page.spec.ts
```

### Run Tests with Video Recording
```bash
pnpm test:e2e --video=on
```

### Run Tests with Screenshots
```bash
pnpm playwright test --screenshot=on
```

### Generate HTML Report
```bash
pnpm playwright show-report
```

## Test Configuration

The tests are configured via `playwright.config.ts` in the project root:

- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:3000`
- **Browser**: Chromium (Desktop Chrome)
- **Retries**: 2 (in CI), 0 (locally)
- **Video**: Recorded on failure
- **Screenshots**: Captured on failure
- **Timeout**: 30 seconds for navigation, 15 seconds for actions

## Test Data Requirements

For comprehensive testing, ensure your test database contains:

- **Teachers**: At least 5 teachers with various departments
- **Subjects**: At least 10 subjects with different credits
- **Rooms**: At least 5 rooms in different buildings
- **Grade Levels**: 3 grade levels with 2-3 classes each
- **Semester**: At least 1 configured semester with timeslots
- **Sample Data**: Some assigned subjects and arranged timetable data

## Test Coverage

### Phase 1: Critical Path (8 tests)
✅ Authentication and authorization  
✅ Core data management (teachers, subjects, rooms)  
✅ Timetable configuration  
✅ Subject assignment  
✅ Timetable arrangement  
✅ Conflict detection  
✅ View schedules  
✅ Export to Excel  

### Phase 2: Core Features (10 tests)
✅ Additional data management  
✅ Copy from previous semester  
✅ Student timetable arrangement  
✅ Lock timeslots  
✅ View student schedules  
✅ Additional export formats (PDF)  

### Phase 3: Extended Features (11 tests)
✅ Unlock timeslots  
✅ Summary views  
✅ Edge cases and error handling  
✅ Mobile responsiveness  

## Screenshots and Videos

Test artifacts are stored in:
- **Screenshots**: `test-results/screenshots/`
- **Videos**: `test-results/artifacts/` (on failure)
- **HTML Report**: `playwright-report/`

## Authentication Notes

⚠️ **Google OAuth Testing**

The current tests do not fully implement Google OAuth authentication due to complexity. For complete E2E testing:

1. **Option A: Mock Authentication**
   - Set up a mock auth provider for testing
   - Use session tokens directly

2. **Option B: Test Accounts**
   - Create dedicated Google test accounts
   - Store credentials securely (never in code)
   - Implement proper OAuth flow in `helpers/auth.ts`

3. **Option C: Bypass Authentication**
   - Configure Next-Auth for test environment
   - Allow test-mode bypass with special credentials

## Interpreting Test Results

### Success ✅
- Test passed with all assertions met
- Screenshots show expected UI state
- No errors in console logs

### Failure ❌
- Review screenshot to see actual state
- Check video recording for interaction flow
- Review console logs for errors
- Verify test data exists

### Skipped ⏭️
- Test requires authentication or data not present
- May need manual setup or configuration

## Manual Testing Checklist

Some scenarios require manual verification:

- [ ] Google OAuth login flow with real credentials
- [ ] File download and content verification (Excel/PDF)
- [ ] Drag-and-drop interactions (complex gestures)
- [ ] Real-time conflict detection during arrangement
- [ ] Concurrent user editing scenarios
- [ ] Mobile device testing on actual devices

## Continuous Integration

For CI/CD pipelines:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Install dependencies
  run: pnpm install

- name: Install Playwright
  run: pnpm playwright install --with-deps

- name: Run E2E tests
  run: pnpm test:e2e
  
- name: Upload test results
  if: always()
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: playwright-report
    path: playwright-report/
```

## Troubleshooting

### Tests Timing Out
- Increase timeout in `playwright.config.ts`
- Check if dev server started successfully
- Verify network connectivity

### Authentication Failures
- Ensure `.env` file is configured
- Check NextAuth configuration
- Review middleware redirects

### Database Errors
- Verify database is running
- Check Prisma migrations are applied
- Ensure test data is seeded

### Screenshots Not Captured
- Check `test-results/` directory permissions
- Verify screenshot configuration in playwright.config.ts
- Ensure tests reach screenshot commands

## Contributing

When adding new tests:

1. Follow existing naming conventions (TC-XXX-YY)
2. Add descriptive test names
3. Include screenshots for visual verification
4. Document prerequisites and expected outcomes
5. Update TEST_PLAN.md with new test cases
6. Ensure tests can run independently
