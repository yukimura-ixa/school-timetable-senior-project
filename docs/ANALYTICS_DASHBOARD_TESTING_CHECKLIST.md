- [ ] Expand/collapse button (chevron icon) is visible in header
- [ ] Dashboard is **expanded by default** (showAnalytics = true)
- [ ] If loading: Skeleton components appear

- [ ] Skeleton has resource totals section (4 boxes)
- [ ] Skeleton has academic year list section
- [ ] Skeleton transitions smoothly to actual dashboard
- [ ] No layout shift during transition

**Expected Behavior**:
- Skeleton should appear for 100-500ms (depending on data fetch speed)
- Smooth transition without jarring layout changes
- All skeleton elements match final dashboard positions

---

### 3. Overview Statistics (Top Row - 4 Cards)

**What to Check**:

### 8. Collapse/Expand Functionality

**Test Steps**:
1. [ ] Click the chevron icon in dashboard header
2. [ ] Dashboard should collapse (slide up animation)
3. [ ] Chevron icon changes from ‚ñ≤ (ExpandLess) to ‚ñº (ExpandMore)
4. [ ] Click again
5. [ ] Dashboard expands (slide down animation)
6. [ ] Chevron icon changes back to ‚ñ≤

**Animation Checks**:

- [ ] No content jumping or layout shift
- [ ] Animation duration feels natural (~300ms)
- [ ] Content below dashboard moves up/down smoothly

**State Persistence**:
- [ ] Collapsed state persists during navigation (if using client-side state)
- [ ] Refresh resets to default expanded state

---

### 9. Responsive Design Testing

**Desktop (>960px)**:
- [ ] Overview stats: 4 cards per row
- [ ] Resource totals: 4 boxes per row
- [ ] All sections visible without scrolling (if reasonable data)
- [ ] Proper spacing between sections

**Tablet (600px - 960px)**:
- [ ] Overview stats: 2 cards per row
- [ ] Resource totals: 2 boxes per row
- [ ] Status/completeness bars adapt to width
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling

**Mobile (<600px)**:
- [ ] Overview stats: 1 card per row (stacked)
- [ ] Resource totals: 1 box per row (stacked)
- [ ] Progress bars use full width
- [ ] Text is readable without zooming
- [ ] Sections stack vertically

**Resize Testing**:
- [ ] Resize browser window from desktop ‚Üí tablet ‚Üí mobile
- [ ] Layout adapts smoothly at breakpoints
- [ ] No broken layouts or overflow issues

---

### 10. Data Accuracy Validation

**Manual Calculation Test**:
1. [ ] Count total semesters in "All Semesters" section
2. [ ] Compare with "‡∏à‡∏≥‡∏ô‡∏ß‡∏ô‡∏ó‡∏±‡πâ‡∏á‡∏´‡∏°‡∏î" stat ‚Üí Should match

3. [ ] Count pinned semesters (star icon on cards)
4. [ ] Compare with "‡∏õ‡∏±‡∏Å‡∏´‡∏°‡∏∏‡∏î" stat ‚Üí Should match

5. [ ] Count semesters by status (draft/published/locked/archived)
6. [ ] Compare with Status Distribution section ‚Üí Should match

7. [ ] Check 3-5 semester cards for completeness percentage
8. [ ] Calculate average manually
9. [ ] Compare with "‡∏Ñ‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏°‡∏™‡∏°‡∏ö‡∏π‡∏£‡∏ì‡πå‡πÄ‡∏â‡∏•‡∏µ‡πà‡∏¢" ‚Üí Should be close (¬±1% acceptable)

**Resource Count Validation**:
- [ ] Expand a few semester cards
- [ ] Note their class/teacher/subject/room counts
- [ ] Verify resource totals make sense (should be sum of unique IDs across all semesters)

---

### 11. Edge Cases

**No Semesters**:
- [ ] Delete/hide all semesters (if possible in dev)
- [ ] Dashboard should **not appear** at all
- [ ] Page shows "‡πÑ‡∏°‡πà‡∏°‡∏µ‡∏†‡∏≤‡∏Ñ‡πÄ‡∏£‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏ô" or similar empty state

**Only 1 Semester**:
- [ ] Analytics should still work
- [ ] Percentages should be 100% for that semester's status
- [ ] No division by zero errors

**All Same Status**:
- [ ] If all semesters are DRAFT
- [ ] Draft bar should show 100%
- [ ] Other bars should show 0% (or not display)

**Zero Completeness**:
- [ ] If semesters have 0% completeness
- [ ] Average should show "0.0%"
- [ ] All should be in "‡∏ï‡πà‡∏≥" (<31%) category

**100% Completeness**:
- [ ] If semesters have 100% completeness
- [ ] Average should show "100.0%"
- [ ] All should be in "‡∏™‡∏π‡∏á" (80%+) category

---

### 12. Performance Testing

**Load Time**:
- [ ] Dashboard appears within 500ms of page load
- [ ] No noticeable lag when expanding/collapsing
- [ ] Scrolling is smooth (60fps)

**Re-render Testing**:
- [ ] Filter semesters (if filters exist)
- [ ] Dashboard should update with filtered data
- [ ] No full page re-render (React optimization working)

**Large Dataset** (if available):
- [ ] Test with 50+ semesters
- [ ] Analytics calculations complete quickly (<100ms)
- [ ] useMemo optimization prevents re-calculations on unrelated state changes

---

### 13. Accessibility Testing

**Keyboard Navigation**:
- [ ] Tab to dashboard header
- [ ] Tab to expand/collapse button
- [ ] Press Enter/Space ‚Üí Should toggle collapse
- [ ] Tab through stat cards (if focusable)

**Screen Reader** (if available):
- [ ] Section titles are announced
- [ ] Stat values are announced with context
- [ ] Button has proper ARIA label ("Expand/Collapse Analytics Dashboard")

**Color Contrast**:
- [ ] All text meets WCAG AA standard (4.5:1 ratio)
- [ ] Progress bars are distinguishable by color blind users
- [ ] Consider adding patterns/textures to bars (future enhancement)

---

### 14. Integration Testing

**With Other Page Sections**:
- [ ] Analytics appears **after** error alert (if any)
- [ ] Analytics appears **before** recent semesters section
- [ ] No overlap with semester filters
- [ ] No layout conflicts with semester cards

**With Loading States**:
- [ ] When page is loading, skeleton appears
- [ ] When data loads, analytics updates
- [ ] Skeleton ‚Üí Dashboard transition is smooth

**With Navigation**:
- [ ] Navigate away from page
- [ ] Navigate back
