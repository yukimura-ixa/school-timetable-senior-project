## Exploratory Testing Results

### Screenshots Captured

1. **Home Page** (`01-home-page.png`)
   - ✅ Page loads successfully
   - ✅ Sign-in button visible
   - ✅ View schedules button visible
   - ✅ Thai language UI confirmed

2. **Sign-in Flow** (`02-signin-oauth-error.png`)
   - ⚠️ Google OAuth requires configuration
   - ✅ Auth flow identified
   - 📝 Note: OAuth setup needed for full authentication testing

3. **Dashboard Semester Selector** (`03-dashboard-semester-selector.png`)
   - ✅ Semester selection interface works
   - ✅ Year dropdown functional (2566-2569)
   - ✅ Semester dropdown functional (1-2)
   - ✅ Navigation to dashboard successful

4. **Student Table View** (`04-student-table-loading.png`, `05-student-table-no-data.png`)
   - ✅ Page structure loads correctly
   - ✅ Sidebar navigation present
   - ⚠️ API returns 404 (no data in database)
   - ✅ Error handling displays user-friendly messages

### Findings

#### ✅ Working Correctly
- Next.js development server runs without issues
- UI components render properly
- Navigation between pages works
- Responsive design elements visible
- Error messages display appropriately
- Page routing functions correctly

#### ⚠️ Requires Setup
- **Database**: No test data present
  - APIs return 404 for timeslots, grade levels
  - Solution: Run database migrations and seed data
  
- **Authentication**: OAuth configuration needed
  - NextAuth warnings in console
  - Solution: Configure Google OAuth or implement test auth bypass

- **API Endpoints**: Some returning errors
  - Need to verify Prisma schema is migrated
  - Database connection needs validation

## Test Execution Commands

### Basic Execution
```bash
# Run all E2E tests
pnpm test:e2e

# Run with UI mode (recommended for development)
pnpm test:e2e:ui

# Run specific test file
pnpm playwright test e2e/01-home-page.spec.ts
```

### Advanced Execution
```bash
# Run with video recording
pnpm test:e2e --video=on

# Run in headed mode (see browser)
pnpm test:e2e:headed

# Debug mode
pnpm test:e2e:debug

# View HTML report
pnpm test:report
```

---

## Next Steps for Complete Test Execution

### 1. Database Setup
```bash
# Apply Prisma migrations
pnpm prisma migrate dev

# Generate Prisma client
pnpm prisma generate

# (Optional) Seed test data
pnpm prisma db seed
```

### 2. Configure Authentication
**Option A**: Set up Google OAuth
- Create OAuth credentials in Google Cloud Console
- Update `.env` with credentials

**Option B**: Test authentication bypass
- Modify NextAuth config for test environment
- Use session mocking

### 3. Run Full Test Suite
```bash
# Start dev server
pnpm dev

# In another terminal, run tests
pnpm test:e2e --video=on --screenshot=on

# View results
pnpm test:report
```

### 4. Review Results
- Check `playwright-report/index.html` for detailed results
- Review screenshots in `test-results/screenshots/`
- Watch videos of failed tests in `test-results/artifacts/`

- WebKit/Safari (can be enabled in playwright.config.ts)
- Mobile viewports (can be enabled in playwright.config.ts)

---

## Performance Notes

- **Page Load**: < 2 seconds for all tested pages
- **Navigation**: Instant (client-side routing)
- **Test Execution**: ~30 seconds per test file (estimated)
- **Full Suite**: ~5-10 minutes (estimated with 29 tests)

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **OAuth Testing**: Requires manual configuration or mocking
2. **Database Dependency**: Tests expect seeded data
3. **API Availability**: Backend must be fully operational
4. **Complex Interactions**: Drag-and-drop requires real browser testing

### Workarounds
1. Use Playwright UI mode for interactive debugging
2. Mock API responses where appropriate
3. Create database fixtures for consistent testing
4. Document manual testing steps for complex flows

---

## Recommendations

### For Immediate Use
1. ✅ Use tests for smoke testing (page loads, navigation)
2. ✅ Validate UI components render correctly
3. ✅ Check responsive design
4. ✅ Verify error handling

### For Full Automation
1. Set up dedicated test database with seed data
2. Configure authentication for automated testing
3. Implement CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions workflow included in guide)
4. Schedule regular test runs
5. Monitor test results dashboard

### For Future Enhancements
1. Add visual regression testing (Percy, Chromatic)
2. Implement API contract testing
3. Add performance benchmarking
4. Create data-driven tests with multiple scenarios
5. Add accessibility testing (axe-core)
