## 🚀 Next Steps for Go-Live

### Immediate (Before Users Access)
1. **Initialize production admin user**
   ```bash
   export DATABASE_URL="<prod_postgres_url>"
   pnpm admin:seed:prod
   ```
   - Email: `admin@school.local`
   - Password: `admin123`
   - ⚠️ Change password immediately after first login

2. **Test admin login**
   - Navigate to https://phrasongsa-timetable.vercel.app/signin
   - Login with admin credentials
   - Verify dashboard loads correctly

3. **Create initial backup**
   ```bash
   pnpm exec tsx scripts/db-backup.ts
   ```

### First 24 Hours
- [ ] Monitor error logs (Vercel runtime logs)
- [ ] Check performance metrics (Vercel Analytics)
- [ ] Verify database backup completes
- [ ] Test core workflows manually:
  - [ ] Admin login/logout
  - [ ] Dashboard view
  - [ ] Timetable access
  - [ ] Mobile responsiveness

### First Week
- [ ] Run full E2E test suite against production
- [ ] Collect user feedback
