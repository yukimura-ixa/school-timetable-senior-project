# Quick Start Guide - Post Migration

## ✅ Migration Complete!

Your project has been successfully migrated to:
- **Tailwind CSS v4.1.14** (idiomatic CSS-based configuration)
- **MUI v7.3.4** (latest stable version)

---

## 🚀 Quick Test Commands

### 1. **Start Development Server**
```bash
pnpm dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and visually inspect:
- ✅ All pages load without errors
- ✅ Buttons and forms render correctly (MUI v7)
- ✅ Colors, shadows, borders appear as expected (Tailwind v4)
- ✅ Focus states work (ring, outline utilities)

### 2. **Run Tests**
```bash
# Unit tests
pnpm test

# E2E tests
pnpm test:e2e

# Lint
pnpm lint
```

### 3. **Build for Production**
```bash
pnpm build
```

Check for any warnings or errors in the build output.

## 📋 What Was Changed

### Files Modified
1. ✅ `src/app/globals.css` - Added v4 CSS config (`@source`, `@theme`)
2. ✅ `postcss.config.js` - Removed redundant `autoprefixer`
3. ✅ `package.json` - Upgraded MUI packages

### No Breaking Changes Expected
- Most Tailwind utilities are compatible
- Border colors already explicit in codebase
- MUI components should work without changes

## ⚠️ If You See Issues

### MUI-Related Issues

**If you see deprecation warnings** about class names:
```bash
# Run automatic codemods
npx @mui/codemod@latest deprecations/button-classes src/
npx @mui/codemod@latest deprecations/chip-classes src/
```

**If theme-related errors occur**:
```bash
npx @mui/codemod@latest v5.0.0/theme-palette-mode src/
```

### Tailwind-Related Issues

**If shadows look different**:
- Check components using `drop-shadow-sm`
- Tailwind v4 may render shadows slightly differently

**If focus states look different**:
- Check components using `ring` (now 1px instead of 3px in v3)
- Use `ring-3` explicitly if you want the old 3px ring

**If borders disappeared**:
- Tailwind v4 requires explicit border colors
- Most of your code already has this ✅

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test the app** - Run `pnpm dev` and click through all features
2. **Run tests** - Ensure no regressions: `pnpm test` + `pnpm test:e2e`
3. **Optional cleanup**:
   - Delete `tailwind.config.ts` if not needed for IDE
   - Update `outline-none` → `outline-hidden` in `globals.css` for accessibility
