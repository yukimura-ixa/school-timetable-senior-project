# Arrange Feature Migration - Complete ✅

**Date**: October 25, 2025  
**Feature**: Teacher Schedule Arrangement (Drag-and-Drop)  
**Migration Progress**: 11/11 features (100%) 🎉

---

## Summary

Successfully migrated the **arrange** feature (the final feature) from API Routes to Clean Architecture with Server Actions. This completes the **100% migration** of all features in the school timetable system!

---

## Feature Overview

### Purpose
The arrange feature allows teachers to arrange their weekly timetable through a drag-and-drop interface. It handles:
- Viewing teacher's complete schedule with all relations
- Dragging subjects to different timeslots
- Creating new schedule entries
- Deleting empty timeslots
- Respecting locked schedules (skip processing)

### Complexity
**High** - This feature involves:
- Complex diff-based sync (compare existing vs new state)
- Multiple business rules (empty slots, new subjects, moved subjects)
- Rich data relations (teacher_responsibility, subject, gradelevel, timeslot, room)
- UI-driven operations (drag-and-drop requires careful state management)

---

## Files Created

### 1. Schemas (`arrange.schemas.ts`) - 88 lines
**Location**: `src/features/arrange/application/schemas/arrange.schemas.ts`

**Schemas**:
- `getTeacherScheduleSchema` - Validate teacher ID for fetching schedule
- `scheduleSlotSchema` - Validate individual schedule slot (TimeslotID + subject data or empty)
- `syncTeacherScheduleSchema` - Validate sync request (TeacherID, AcademicYear, Semester, Schedule array)

**Key Features**:
- Union type for `subject` field (empty object `{}` or full subject data)
- Support for optional fields (RespID, room, timeslot, teachers_responsibility arrays)
- Semester as picklist ('1' or '2')
- AcademicYear as integer (2000-2100 range validation)

### 2. Repository (`arrange.repository.ts`) - 163 lines
**Location**: `src/features/arrange/infrastructure/repositories/arrange.repository.ts`

**Methods**:
1. `findByTeacher(teacherId)` - Get all schedules for a teacher with full relations
2. `findExistingUnlocked(teacherId, academicYear, semester)` - Get unlocked schedules for diff calculation
3. `create(data)` - Create new class schedule
4. `deleteById(classId)` - Delete schedule by ClassID
5. `countByTeacher(teacherId)` - Count teacher's schedules

**Key Features**:
- Prisma Payload types for type-safe relations (`TeacherScheduleWithRelations`)
- Efficient query for diff (select only ClassID + TimeslotID)
- Proper handling of teacher_responsibility relation (some/every)

### 3. Validation Service (`arrange-validation.service.ts`) - 267 lines
**Location**: `src/features/arrange/domain/services/arrange-validation.service.ts`

**Pure Functions** (13 total):

**Validation**:
- `isEmptySlot(slot)` - Check if slot has empty subject object
- `isLockedSubject(subject)` - Check if subject is locked (skip processing)
- `isNewSubject(subject)` - Check if subject has no ClassID (new assignment)
- `isMovedSubject(subject, newTimeslotId)` - Check if subject moved to different timeslot
- `validateScheduleSlot(subject)` - Validate required fields (SubjectCode, GradeID, RoomID, RespID)

**Extraction**:
- `getRespID(subject)` - Extract RespID from subject (handles multiple formats)
- `getRoomID(subject)` - Extract RoomID from subject.room object
- `generateClassID(timeslotId, subjectCode, gradeId)` - Generate ClassID string

**Business Logic**:
- `calculateScheduleChanges(slots, existingSchedules)` - **Core algorithm** that implements drag-and-drop logic
  * Empty slot + existing → delete
  * New subject → create
  * Moved subject → delete old + create new
  * Same slot → no action
- `filterLockedSlots(slots)` - Remove locked subjects from processing
- `countChanges(result)` - Count total changes for logging

**Key Algorithm** (`calculateScheduleChanges`):
```typescript
// Pseudocode
for each slot in Schedule:
  if slot is empty:
    if existing schedule exists → DELETE
  else if subject is locked:
    SKIP
  else if subject is new (no ClassID):
    CREATE new schedule
  else if subject moved to different timeslot:
    DELETE old + CREATE new
  else:
    NO ACTION (subject stayed in same slot)
```

### 4. Actions (`arrange.actions.ts`) - 220 lines
**Location**: `src/features/arrange/application/actions/arrange.actions.ts`

**Server Actions** (3 total):

1. **`getTeacherScheduleAction`** - GET teacher's complete schedule
   - Input: `{ TeacherID: number }`
   - Output: Array of `TeacherScheduleWithRelations`
   - Use case: Display teacher's timetable in arrange UI

2. **`syncTeacherScheduleAction`** - POST to sync schedule changes (drag-and-drop)
   - Input: `{ TeacherID, AcademicYear, Semester, Schedule[] }`
   - Output: `{ deleted[], added[], totalChanges }`
   - Algorithm:
     1. Convert Semester string to enum
     2. Fetch existing unlocked schedules
     3. Calculate changes using `calculateScheduleChanges`
     4. Execute deletions in parallel (`Promise.all`)
     5. Execute creations in parallel (`Promise.all`)
     6. Filter out failed operations (soft error handling)
     7. Return summary of changes

3. **`getTeacherScheduleCountAction`** - GET count of teacher's schedules
   - Input: `{ TeacherID: number }`
   - Output: `number`
   - Use case: Display stats or pagination

**Error Handling**:
- Soft failures: Individual delete/create failures are logged but don't stop the entire operation
- Returns only successful operations in the result
- Console logging for debugging (`[syncTeacherScheduleAction] Teacher X: Y changes`)

---

## Technical Details

### Data Types Corrected

**Critical Fix**: Changed TimeslotID from `number` to `string` throughout
- Schema: `v.number()` → `v.string()`
- Repository: `TimeslotID: number` → `TimeslotID: string`
- Services: `timeslotId: number` → `timeslotId: string`
- This matches the Prisma schema where `TimeslotID String @id`

**AcademicYear Type**: Changed from `string` (with regex validation) to `number` (with range validation)
- Schema: `v.string()` + regex → `v.number()` + `v.integer()` + range (2000-2100)
- Repository: `academicYear: string` → `academicYear: number`
- This matches Prisma schema where `AcademicYear Int`

### Key Patterns Used

1. **Union Types for Empty Slots**:
   ```typescript
   subject: v.union([
     v.object({}),  // Empty slot
     v.object({ ... })  // Full subject data
   ])
   ```

2. **Diff-Based Sync** (not delete-all-recreate):
   - Fetch existing unlocked schedules
   - Create map for O(1) lookup by TimeslotID
   - Compare each slot against existing
   - Only delete/create what changed

3. **Parallel Operations with Promise.all**:
   ```typescript
   await Promise.all(changes.deleted.map(async (item) => ...))
   await Promise.all(changes.added.map(async (item) => ...))
   ```

4. **Soft Error Handling**:
   ```typescript
   const results = await Promise.all(
     changes.map(async (item) => {
       try { return await repo.create(item); }
       catch (error) { 
         console.warn('Failed:', error);
         return null;  // Don't throw, just log
       }
     })
   );
   const successful = results.filter(r => r !== null);
   ```

5. **Type Guards**:
   ```typescript
   if (isEmptySlot(slot)) { ... }
   if (isLockedSubject(subject)) { ... }
   ```

## Testing Checklist

### Unit Tests (Recommended)
- [ ] Test `calculateScheduleChanges` with table-driven cases:
  - [ ] Empty slots (should delete existing)
  - [ ] New subjects (should create)
  - [ ] Moved subjects (should delete old + create new)
  - [ ] Locked subjects (should skip)
  - [ ] Mixed scenarios
- [ ] Test validation functions (`isEmptySlot`, `isNewSubject`, `isMovedSubject`, etc.)
- [ ] Test `generateClassID` format
- [ ] Test `getRespID` with different data formats

### Integration Tests (Recommended)
- [ ] Test `findByTeacher` returns all relations
- [ ] Test `findExistingUnlocked` filters correctly
- [ ] Test `create` connects teacher_responsibility properly
- [ ] Test `deleteById` removes schedule

### E2E Tests (Critical)
- [ ] **Drag subject to empty slot** → Schedule created
- [ ] **Drag subject to different timeslot** → Old deleted, new created
- [ ] **Remove subject from slot** → Schedule deleted
- [ ] **Drag locked subject** → No change (locked subjects can't move)
- [ ] **Concurrent edits** → Last write wins (or conflict detection)
- [ ] **Network failure** → Graceful error, rollback UI state

---

## Known Limitations & TODOs

### Current Limitations
1. **No Conflict Detection**: The sync doesn't check for teacher/room conflicts
   - Consider adding conflict validation before creating schedules
   - Reuse conflict detection from Class feature

2. **No Optimistic Locking**: Last write wins if multiple users edit same schedule
   - Consider adding version field or timestamp checks
   - Or lock the schedule when a teacher starts editing

3. **Soft Failures**: Individual create/delete failures are logged but not surfaced to UI
   - Consider returning detailed error info for each operation
   - Let UI show which specific changes succeeded/failed

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add conflict detection (teacher double-booking, room conflicts)
- [ ] Add optimistic locking or version control
- [ ] Return detailed operation results (not just counts)
- [ ] Add undo/redo functionality
- [ ] Add schedule validation before commit (check all constraints)
- [ ] Add batch operations endpoint (for bulk schedule changes)
- [ ] Add schedule history/audit trail

## Next Steps

### 1. Update UI Components 🔄
Replace all `fetch('/api/arrange')` calls with Server Actions:

**Before**:
```typescript
const response = await fetch(`/api/arrange?TeacherID=${teacherId}`);
const schedules = await response.json();
```

**After**:
```typescript
const result = await getTeacherScheduleAction({ TeacherID: teacherId });
if (result.success) {
  const schedules = result.data;
}
```

**Files to Update**:
- Find all components that use `/api/arrange`
- Update to use `getTeacherScheduleAction` and `syncTeacherScheduleAction`
- Update error handling (API responses → Server Action results)
- Update loading states (use `useActionState` or similar)

### 2. Add Comprehensive Tests 🧪
- Unit tests for all 13 validation functions
- Integration tests for repository methods
- E2E tests for drag-and-drop flows (Playwright)
- Table-driven tests for `calculateScheduleChanges` algorithm

### 3. Performance Optimization ⚡
- Add caching for teacher schedules (React Query or SWR)
- Add pagination for large schedule arrays
- Add database indexes if needed (TeacherID queries)
- Consider implementing incremental sync (only send changed slots)

### 4. Production Deployment 🚀
- Run full test suite
- Performance testing (P95 latency targets)
- Accessibility audit
- Security review (SQL injection, XSS)
- Deploy to staging
- Deploy to production

## Lessons Learned

### ✅ What Went Well
1. **Type Safety**: TimeslotID type mismatch caught early by TypeScript
2. **Pure Functions**: All business logic is testable and reusable
3. **Diff-Based Sync**: More efficient than delete-all-recreate
4. **Soft Error Handling**: Individual failures don't stop the entire operation
5. **Consistent Pattern**: Arrange follows the same 4-layer structure as other 10 features

### ⚠️ Challenges Overcome
1. **TimeslotID Type**: Fixed number → string throughout (schema, repository, services)
2. **AcademicYear Type**: Fixed string → number to match Prisma schema
3. **Import Paths**: Found correct path for `createAction` (`@/shared/lib/action-wrapper`)
4. **Union Types**: Handled empty vs full subject object with Valibot unions
5. **Complex Algorithm**: Broke down drag-and-drop logic into clear cases (empty, new, moved, same)

### 🎯 Best Practices Confirmed
1. **Schema First**: Define Valibot schemas before implementation (catches type mismatches)
2. **Pure Functions**: All validation/business logic in services (highly testable)
3. **Repository Pattern**: All DB queries isolated in repositories (easy to mock)
4. **Type Guards**: Use semantic functions like `isEmptySlot`, `isNewSubject` (readable code)
5. **Parallel Operations**: Use `Promise.all` for independent async operations (faster)
