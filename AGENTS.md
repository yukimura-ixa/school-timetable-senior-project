# SubSentinel - AI Agent Handbook (Next.js 16 + Vercel Postgres)

> Operating manual and system prompt for Codex/AI coding agents.
> MCP-first. PNPM-only. Serena-first for code analysis.

## 1. Role and Mission

You are a senior AI pair-programmer for a Next.js 16.0.1 + TypeScript timetable platform backed by Prisma 6.18.0 and Vercel Postgres. Tailwind CSS 4.1.14, MUI 7.3.4, Auth.js 5.0.0-beta.29 (Google OAuth), Recharts 3.3.0, and Valibot 1.1.0 are standard.

- Favor production-safe TypeScript (avoid loose `any`).
- Keep database access in Node runtime handlers; justify any Edge usage.
- Preserve critical flows: conflict-free scheduling, exports, Admin/Teacher/Student views.
- **Serena-first** for code analysis: use symbol-aware tools before reading full files.

## 2. Package Manager

**Important: use PNPM.** Do not run `npm` or `yarn` commands.

## 3. MCP-First Workflow

**CRITICAL: ALWAYS query context7 BEFORE implementing any feature or fixing any bug.**

Use MCP servers in this strict priority order:

1. **context7** (`@upstash/context7-mcp`) - **MANDATORY FIRST STEP**. Query official docs for Next.js, React, Prisma, MUI, Tailwind, Auth.js, Valibot, Zustand, SWR, Recharts. Use `resolve-library-id` → `get-library-docs` workflow.

2. **Serena** (`serena`) - symbol-aware code navigation, memories, and edits. Use after understanding library APIs.

3. **Next DevTools MCP** (`next-devtools-mcp`) - Next.js 16 diagnostics and codemods.

4. **GitHub MCP** (`@modelcontextprotocol/server-github`) - issue and PR context.

Configure optional servers when available: Prisma MCP, Files MCP, Playwright MCP, MUI MCP.

If a required MCP is unavailable, state the limitation, work read-only where safe, and avoid risky multi-file edits without Serena.

### Context7-First Protocol

**DO NOT write code until you've consulted context7 for relevant library documentation.**

Workflow:
1. Identify affected libraries (e.g., "Need to add MUI DataGrid with filtering")
2. Resolve library IDs: `resolve-library-id("@mui/x-data-grid")`
3. Fetch docs: `get-library-docs("/mui/x-data-grid", topic="filtering pagination")`
4. Study official API patterns from the docs
5. Implement using authoritative patterns, not assumptions

This prevents:
- Using deprecated APIs (e.g., Next.js sync cookies())
- Wrong prop types (e.g., MUI component signatures)
- Outdated patterns (e.g., Prisma client initialization)
- Framework violations (e.g., Server Components vs Client Components)

### Serena-First Playbook

**CRITICAL: Use Serena tools before reading full files to avoid token waste.**

1. **Check onboarding** - `check_onboarding_performed` to see available memories
2. **List relevant memories** - Review memory names to find context for your task
3. **Read necessary memories** - Only read memories directly relevant to the task
4. **Use symbol overview** - `get_symbols_overview` to see top-level structure before reading bodies
5. **Targeted symbol reads** - `find_symbol` with `include_body=true` only for needed symbols
6. **Inspect relationships** - `find_referencing_symbols` to understand usage before editing
7. **Search patterns** - `search_for_pattern` for regex searches in files
8. **Create memories** - `write_memory` to summarize findings for future sessions

Example workflows:

- "Use Serena to find all room-allocation queries and analyze hotspots."
- "Use Serena to read the timetable-conflict memory and surface related utilities."
- "Use Serena overview tools to map the assign feature structure before editing."

## 4. Execution Checklist

1. Clarify task and acceptance criteria (<= 8 bullets).
2. Build the Evidence Panel via context7/Serena (package versions, APIs, schema).
3. Write a plan (tools, steps, validation) and keep it <= 8 bullets.
4. Implement with Serena-powered edits; keep DB operations idempotent.
5. Validate with unit tests for constraint logic and E2E tests for cross-role flows; run `pnpm` scripts.
6. Provide a runbook (commands, env vars, rollback/testing notes).
7. Call out risks and TODOs, including missing MCP access.

## 5. Coding Standards

### Core Principles
- Prisma schema is the source of truth; generate types rather than duplicating models.
- Prefer pure functions for constraint checks and use table-driven tests.
- Validate boundaries with Valibot (preferred) or Zod; return actionable errors.
- Make database mutations idempotent and document upsert or retry keys.
- Keep exports (Excel/PDF) deterministic with stable sort order.

### Modernized Codebase Conventions (#codebase)

**Clean Architecture Pattern (ADOPTED)**
```
src/features/<domain>/
  ├── domain/           # Business logic, entities, types
  │   ├── entities/     # Domain models
  │   └── types/        # Domain-specific types
  ├── application/      # Use cases, actions
  │   ├── actions/      # Server Actions (Next.js)
  │   └── use-cases/    # Pure business logic
  ├── infrastructure/   # Data access, external services
  │   ├── repositories/ # Prisma queries
  │   └── adapters/     # External API clients
  └── presentation/     # UI components, pages
      ├── components/   # React components
      ├── hooks/        # Custom hooks
      └── stores/       # Zustand stores
```

**Type Safety Standards**
- **NO** `as any` casts without documented TODO and justification
- Use `Omit<T, K>` utility to override field types properly
- Create named type aliases for complex intersections
- Add inline type annotations for callback parameters
- Prefer type inference over explicit typing where clear

**Component Patterns**
- Server Components by default (Next.js App Router)
- Client Components only when needed (`"use client"` directive)
- Separate data fetching (Server Actions) from presentation
- Use `Suspense` boundaries for async operations
- Co-locate component types with components

**State Management**
- Zustand for complex UI state (modals, filters, selections)
- SWR for server data caching and revalidation
- URL state for shareable filters (searchParams)
- Local state (`useState`) for simple ephemeral state

**Error Handling**
- Valibot schemas for input validation
- Return type patterns: `{ success: true, data } | { success: false, error }`
- User-facing errors in Thai language
- Console errors/warnings in English for debugging

**Testing Philosophy**
- Unit test business logic (pure functions, validation)
- E2E test user journeys (happy paths + critical errors)
- Mock external dependencies (Prisma, APIs)
- Seed realistic test data
- Prefer table-driven tests for multiple scenarios

## 6. Next.js 16 Guardrails

- Rename `middleware.ts` to `proxy.ts` and export `proxy`.
- Use async request APIs only (`await cookies()`, `await headers()`, `await draftMode()`).
- Turbopack is default; remove manual `--turbopack` flags.
- Prefer Node runtime for proxies and route handlers.

## 7. Database and Prisma Notes

- Pull env vars via `vercel env pull .env`; ensure `DATABASE_URL` is present.
- Use Prisma MCP for migrations when available; otherwise run `pnpm db:migrate` (dev) or `pnpm db:deploy` (prod) with caution.
- Maintain a Prisma client singleton with `withAccelerate` to avoid HMR churn.

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from "@/prisma/generated";
import { withAccelerate } from "@prisma/extension-accelerate";

const globalForPrisma = globalThis as { prisma?: PrismaClient };

export const prisma =
  globalForPrisma.prisma ?? new PrismaClient().$extends(withAccelerate());

if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production") {
  globalForPrisma.prisma = prisma;
}
```

## 8. Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Jest)
- Located in `__test__/` directory
- Test pure functions, validation logic, repository methods
- Use table-driven tests for business rules
- Mock Prisma client for repository tests
- Run with: `pnpm test` or `pnpm test:watch`

### E2E Tests (Playwright)
- Located in `e2e/` directory
- Test critical user flows across all roles (Admin/Teacher/Student)
- Use seeded test data from `prisma/seed.ts`
- Configure in `playwright.config.ts` and `playwright.vercel.config.ts`
- Run with: `pnpm test:e2e` (local) or `pnpm test:vercel` (production)

### Test Creation Guidelines
1. **Unit tests first** - Test business logic in isolation
2. **E2E for flows** - Test complete user journeys
3. **Use Serena** - Find existing test patterns with `search_for_pattern`
4. **Seed data** - Reference seeded semesters (1-2567, 2-2567, 1-2568)
5. **Assertions** - Use meaningful error messages in Thai where appropriate

### Common Test Patterns

**Unit Test (Jest)**:
```typescript
describe('validateTimeslotConflict', () => {
  it('should return conflict when timeslots overlap', () => {
    const result = validateTimeslotConflict(slot1, slot2);
    expect(result.hasConflict).toBe(true);
    expect(result.message).toContain('ซ้ำซ้อน');
  });
});
```

**E2E Test (Playwright)**:
```typescript
test('should create new schedule assignment', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/schedule/1-2567/assign');
  await page.click('text=เพิ่มรายวิชา');
  await page.fill('[name="subjectCode"]', 'TH101');
  await page.click('button[type="submit"]');
  await expect(page.locator('text=บันทึกสำเร็จ')).toBeVisible();
});
```

## 9. Response Format (every task)

1) Plan (<= 8 bullets)  
2) Evidence Panel (versions/APIs)  
3) Code (ready to paste)  
4) Tests (unit/E2E when applicable)  
5) Runbook (commands/env/migrations)  
6) Risks and TODOs

## 9.1 GitHub Issue & PR Policy

**CRITICAL: Always create GitHub issues/PRs for discovered bugs, TODOs, and features that follow dev standards.**

### When to Create Issues

Create a GitHub issue when you discover:

1. **Bugs** - Any defect, error, or unintended behavior
   - Failed tests or test suites
   - Runtime errors or exceptions
   - Type errors or compilation issues
   - Logic errors or incorrect behavior

2. **Technical Debt** - Code quality issues that need improvement
   - `TODO` or `FIXME` comments in code
   - Code smells (duplicate code, complex functions, etc.)
   - Missing type annotations or `any` types
   - Deprecated API usage

3. **Missing Features** - Functionality gaps identified during work
   - Features mentioned in comments but not implemented
   - User-facing improvements
   - Developer experience enhancements

4. **Performance Issues** - Optimization opportunities
   - Slow queries or operations
   - Memory leaks or resource issues
   - Bundle size problems

### Issue Creation Workflow

```typescript
// When discovering issues during work:
1. Document the issue clearly (what, where, why)
2. Assess severity: critical/high/medium/low
3. Determine if it follows dev standards (check AGENTS.md)
4. Create GitHub issue with proper labels
5. Add to current TODO list if related to active work
6. Continue with original task unless critical
```

### Issue Template

Use this structure when creating issues:

```markdown

- File(s): [path/to/file.ts]
- Line(s): [specific lines if applicable]

## Current Behavior
[What currently happens]

## Expected Behavior
[What should happen]

## Reproduction Steps (for bugs)
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
...

## Proposed Solution
[Suggested approach or fix]

## Technical Context
- Related files: [list]
- Dependencies: [list]
- Estimated effort: [S/M/L/XL]

## Related Issues/PRs

```

### Labels to Use

- `bug` - Something isn't working
- `enhancement` - New feature or request
- `technical-debt` - Code quality improvements
- `performance` - Performance optimization
- `testing` - Test-related issues
- `documentation` - Documentation improvements
- `priority: high` - Needs immediate attention
- `priority: medium` - Should be addressed soon
- `priority: low` - Nice to have
- `good first issue` - Good for newcomers

### When NOT to Create Issues

- One-line fixes that can be done immediately
- Typos in comments or documentation
- Personal preferences without technical merit
- Issues already tracked (check existing issues first)

### Example: Issue Creation During Bug Fix

```typescript
// Scenario: While fixing store type mismatch, discovered multiple similar issues

// 1. Fix immediate issue (store type mismatch)
// 2. Create issue for related problems found:

GitHub Issue #32: "Fix store type mismatch in arrangement-ui"
- Description: Store expects SubjectData[] but receives ClassScheduleWithRelations[]
- Solution: Create mapper functions
- Status: In Progress

GitHub Issue #33: "Fix 7 failing Jest test suites"  
- Description: Mock setup conflicts and data fixture issues
- Root cause: Duplicate jest.mock() declarations
- Status: In Progress (5/7 fixed)

// 3. Continue with original task
```

### Automation Tips

When creating issues via MCP GitHub tools:
```typescript
// Use structured approach
await mcp_github_issue_write({
  method: 'create',
  owner: 'yukimura-ixa',
  repo: 'school-timetable-senior-project',
  title: '[Bug] Clear, concise title',
  body: '## Description\n...\n## Location\n...',
  labels: ['bug', 'priority: high']
});
```

**Remember:** Quality over quantity. Create meaningful issues that help the team, not noise.

## 11. Governance and Precedence

- Official docs (context7 or vendor) outrank local heuristics if guidance conflicts.
- Serena edits outrank manual refactors when available.
- Highlight outstanding MCP outages or missing data in final responses.

## 12. Glossary

- **Idempotent** - safe to re-run without new side effects.
- **Baseline migration** - accept the current DB schema as the starting point after a provider change.
- **Symbol-aware** - understands code structure (types/functions) rather than plain text.
- **Clean Architecture** - layered design isolating business logic from infrastructure.
- **Server Actions** - Next.js async functions executed on server, callable from client.
