# Exam Arrange Mode - Future Feature Design Document

**Status**: üìã Design Phase - Out of Scope for Current Sprint  
**Priority**: P2/P3 - High Value, Medium-High Effort  
**Estimated Effort**: 16-20 hours  
**Target Release**: Future (After P1-P2 completion)

---

## Problem Statement

Currently, the school timetable system lacks a dedicated mechanism for scheduling and managing examination periods. The lock schedule system was initially considered for this purpose, but **exams are fundamentally different from schedule locks**:

- **Locks** = Recurring weekly constraints (scouts, assemblies, activities)
- **Exams** = Temporary, one-time scheduling events requiring specialized workflows

### Current Gaps:
1. ‚ùå No dedicated exam period configuration
2. ‚ùå No exam-specific scheduling grid
3. ‚ùå No exam timetable validation (all subjects covered, no conflicts)
4. ‚ùå No specialized exam timetable exports
5. ‚ùå Confusion: Using EXAM lock type conflates two different concepts

---

## Business Requirements

### Use Cases:

**UC1: Configure Exam Period**
- **Actor**: Admin
- **Goal**: Define exam period parameters (dates, name, scope)
- **Flow**:
  1. Admin navigates to Exam Arrange mode
  2. Clicks "Create Exam Period"
  3. Fills form: Name, Start Date, End Date, Semester, Academic Year
  4. Selects included grades (all or specific levels)
  5. System validates dates don't overlap with other exam periods
  6. System creates exam period and generates empty exam grid

**UC2: Schedule Exam Slots**
- **Actor**: Admin
- **Goal**: Assign subjects to specific exam time slots
- **Flow**:
  1. Admin opens exam period
  2. Views grid: Days (columns) √ó Periods (rows) √ó Grades (tabs/sections)
  3. Drags subject from sidebar to exam slot
  4. System validates:
     - Subject not already scheduled for this grade
     - Room capacity sufficient
     - No teacher conflicts (if teacher info available)
  5. System saves exam assignment
  6. Grid updates with color-coded subject card

**UC3: Validate Exam Coverage**
- **Actor**: Admin
- **Goal**: Ensure all subjects have exam slots before finalizing
- **Flow**:
  1. Admin clicks "Validate Coverage" button
  2. System checks:
     - All core subjects have exam slots
     - No subject scheduled multiple times for same grade
     - All exam slots are within configured exam period dates
     - Room assignments are valid
  3. System shows report:
     - ‚úÖ Subjects with exams (green checkmarks)
     - ‚ö†Ô∏è Subjects missing exams (yellow warnings)
     - ‚ùå Conflicts detected (red errors)
  4. Admin addresses issues before finalizing

**UC4: Export Exam Timetables**
- **Actor**: Admin, Teacher, Student
- **Goal**: Generate printable/downloadable exam schedules
- **Flows**:
  - **By Grade**: All exams for ‡∏°.1/1, ‡∏°.1/2, etc. (student view)
  - **By Date**: All exams on May 15, May 16, etc. (school-wide view)
  - **By Room**: All exams in Room 101, Room 102, etc. (facility management)
  - **By Teacher**: All exams supervised by Teacher X (invigilator schedule)
  - **Individual Student**: Personalized exam schedule with dates/times/rooms

**UC5: Publish Exam Schedule**
- **Actor**: Admin
- **Goal**: Make exam schedule visible to students/teachers
- **Flow**:
  1. Admin finalizes exam period (validation passes)
  2. Clicks "Publish" button
  3. System marks exam period as published
  4. Students/teachers can now view their exam schedules
  5. Admin can still make emergency adjustments (with audit log)

- Real-time validation feedback
- Progress tracking

### Phase 4: Validation & Export (6 hours)
- ValidationDashboard component
- Coverage checking
- Conflict detection
- PDF export templates
- Excel export templates

### Phase 5: Student Portal (4 hours)
- Public exam schedule lookup
- Student authentication integration

- Performance optimization
- Mobile responsive design
- User documentation

**Total Estimated Effort**: 32 hours (4 work days)

---

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative:
- Time to schedule full exam period: < 2 hours (vs. manual process ~4-6 hours)
- Validation accuracy: 100% (catch all conflicts before publish)
- Export generation time: < 10 seconds for full timetable
- Student portal response time: < 2 seconds
- Zero exam scheduling conflicts after publish

### Qualitative:
- Admin feedback: "Much easier than manual Excel scheduling"
- Student feedback: "Clear, easy to find my exam schedule"
- Teacher feedback: "Helpful for invigilator planning"
- School feedback: "Professional, printable timetables"

---

## Risk Analysis

### Technical Risks:
- **Risk**: Complex validation logic (room conflicts, teacher conflicts)
  - **Mitigation**: Incremental validation, clear error messages
- **Risk**: Performance issues with large schools (many grades/subjects)
  - **Mitigation**: Pagination, lazy loading, database indexing
- **Risk**: Date/time handling across timezones
  - **Mitigation**: Store as UTC, display in school's timezone

### Business Risks:
- **Risk**: Admin learns new workflow (change resistance)
  - **Mitigation**: Product tour, video tutorials, gradual rollout
- **Risk**: Edge cases not covered (split exams, makeup exams)
  - **Mitigation**: Flexible design, custom fields, future iterations

### Data Risks:
- **Risk**: Accidental exam schedule deletion
  - **Mitigation**: Soft delete, audit log, backup/restore
- **Risk**: Unauthorized access to unpublished exams
  - **Mitigation**: Role-based access control, status checks

---

## Future Enhancements (P3+)

1. **AI Auto-Scheduler**: ML model suggests optimal exam schedule
2. **Conflict Resolution Wizard**: Step-by-step guide to fix conflicts
3. **Mobile App**: Native iOS/Android app for students
4. **SMS Notifications**: Send exam reminders via SMS
5. **Seating Arrangement**: Generate seating plans per exam room
6. **Exam Statistics**: Analytics on exam distribution, room usage
7. **Multi-Language Support**: Exam schedules in English/Thai
8. **Accessibility**: Screen reader support, high-contrast mode

---

## Dependencies

### Required:
- Prisma schema migration
- PDF generation library (e.g., jsPDF, Puppeteer)
- Excel generation library (e.g., exceljs)
- Date handling library (date-fns or dayjs)
- Drag-and-drop library (dnd-kit or react-beautiful-dnd)

### Optional:
- Email service for notifications
- SMS gateway for reminders
- Calendar integration (Google Calendar, Outlook)

---

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Extend Lock Schedule
- **Pros**: No new feature, reuse existing code
- **Cons**: Conflates two different concepts, confusing UX, limited validation
- **Decision**: ‚ùå Rejected - Exams are fundamentally different

### Alternative 2: Manual Excel Entry
- **Pros**: Simple, no development needed
- **Cons**: No validation, error-prone, hard to share, no student portal
- **Decision**: ‚ùå Not scalable

### Alternative 3: Third-Party Exam Scheduling Tool
- **Pros**: Off-the-shelf solution, mature features
- **Cons**: Integration complexity, recurring costs, data privacy concerns
- **Decision**: ‚ùå Custom solution better fits existing system

---

## Conclusion

The Exam Arrange Mode is a **high-value feature** that addresses a real pain point in school administration. By providing a dedicated, purpose-built interface for exam scheduling, we:

1. ‚úÖ Separate concerns (exams vs. locks)
2. ‚úÖ Enable specialized workflows
3. ‚úÖ Provide validation and conflict detection
4. ‚úÖ Generate professional outputs
5. ‚úÖ Improve student/teacher experience

**Recommendation**: Prioritize for **P2 implementation** after completing P1 features (Quick Assignment Panel, Unified State Management) and P2 conflict detection.
