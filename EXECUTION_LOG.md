## Infrastructure Status

| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Database | ✅ Running | PostgreSQL 16 on port 5433 |
| Migrations | ✅ Applied | 5 migrations successful |
| Dependencies | ✅ Installed | 1,207 packages |
| Prisma Client | ✅ Generated | v6.18.0 |
| Unit Tests | ✅ Executed | 79.4% pass rate |
| E2E Tests | ⚠️ Ready | Browser install pending |

---

## Key Achievements

1. ✅ Successfully executed comprehensive unit test suite
2. ✅ Fixed critical fetch polyfill issue
3. ✅ Deployed PostgreSQL test database
4. ✅ Applied all Prisma migrations
5. ✅ Configured E2E test environment
6. ✅ Created comprehensive documentation

---

## Known Issues

1. **Playwright Browser Download** (Priority: High)
   - Issue: Chromium and Firefox downloads failing
   - Cause: Network/CDN size mismatch errors
   - Resolution: Retry with stable network or manual installation

2. **Prisma Mock Configuration** (Priority: Medium)
   - Issue: 7 test suites failing due to incomplete mocks
   - Cause: jest.setup.js mock configuration incomplete
   - Resolution: Update mock configuration for all Prisma methods

3. **Integration Test Data** (Priority: Low)
   - Issue: Some tests expect real data vs mocked data
   - Resolution: Separate integration tests, use test database

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate
1. Retry Playwright browser installation
2. Execute E2E test suite once browsers installed
3. Generate HTML test reports

### Short-term
4. Fix Prisma mock configuration
5. Re-run unit tests targeting 90%+ pass rate
6. Separate unit tests from integration tests

### Long-term
7. Set up CI/CD for automated testing
8. Increase test coverage to 90%+
9. Implement visual regression testing
